What makes a senior dev?

*Thoughtworks*
"A senior dev is someone that provides more direction than they require themselves."
3 stages:
Junior - Requires more direction than they provide
Mid - Requires direction, but will also be seen giving it
Senior - Doesn't require direction, just goes ahead and does what's needed.

*Break down*
The above can be broken down into 3 elements:
 * Connectedness/Community
   * Community / OSS
   * Mentorship
   * Empathetic Development
     * Do they look out for the development opportunities of others as well as themselves?
   * Courageous Honesty
 * Technical Capability
   * Curiosity
   * Rigor / Discipline
   * Propensity to ship
   * Fearlessness
 * Leadership
   * Owners mindset
     * Given a project they've spent time on, are they precious about it?
   * Communication / Persuasion
   * Purpose
   * "Next Right Thing"

Connectedness/Community:
A person with community skills has a sense of being part of a larger whole, a desire to contribute, a sense that the other people are not simply characters in their own noise, but fully realised individuals.

Technical Capability:
A person with high technical capability is technically curious, tackles problems without givingup and produces solutions that less experienced folk can use, maintain and learn from.

Leadership:
A person with leadership skills knows how to develop and follow a sense of purpose in themselves, and in others. They are willing to point out, own and fix things that are broken about our company and in their own career tracks.

With aspects of all of the above, you get a developer, which strong sections of each you potentially have a senior developer.

A person with Community + Technical Capability but no Leadership is an Educator.
A person with Leadership + Community but no Technical Capability is a Manager.
A person with Technical Capability + Leadership but no Community is an Architect.

Following on, the Drayfus Model as described by Michael Eraut:
1. Novice
  * "rigid adherence to taught rules or plans"
  * no exercise of "discretionary judgement"
2. Advanced Beginner
  * limited "situational perception"
  * all aspects of work treated separately with equal importance
3. Competent
  * "coping with crowdedness" (multiple activities, accumulation of information)
  * some perception of actions in relation to goals
  * deliberate planning
  * formulates routines
4. Proficient
  * holistic view of situation
  * prioritizes importance of aspects
  * "perceives deviations from the normal pattern"
  * employs ~maxims~ for guidance, with meanings that adapt to the situation at hand.
5. Expert
  * Transcends reliance on rules, guidelines and ~maxims~
  * "intuitive grasp of situations based on deep, tacit understanding
  * has "vision of what is possible"
  * uses "analytical approaches" in new situations or in case of problems.
~

# So you want to be a Senior Developer?

## Preface

You're not a Senior Developer, but you want to become one. You have the drive,
you have the mindset, you're just a little hazy on the details. Then this
posting is directed at you! In this posting I'll be looking at what makes a
Senior Developer, from the mindset to the technical ability and beyond. It's all
very well reading about what makes a Senior Developer, at the end, I'll cover
steps you can take to move you down this particular career path and why these
steps are important.

## Where to start?

One really useful resource is [Matt Briggs: The Role of a Senior Developer](http://mattbriggs.net/blog/2015/06/01/the-role-of-a-senior-developer/).
Go and read that now.

Hopefully you found your mindset resonating with the Senior Developer part. Maybe
you've identified some Intermediate traits in yourself and can see how to
evolve them into the Senior characteristics described.

## What next?
When I was asked what characteristics made up a Senior Developer I was at a loss.
Worse still, I was asked how someone else can become Senior, as though there are
hoops to jump through. Being a Senior Developer is a mindset, and covers more
than just what you do, but also how you think.

I went down the route of looking for what others thought was a Senior Developer.
Perhaps some common traits would fall out.
First step - [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)

### Hacker News
This site, although not looking like much, is a fantastic repository for most things
related to programming. It's also got an eclectic readership and so there were two
articles which were useful in the search. The first one
[Ask HN: What is the difference between a junior and senior developer?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7493290) -
tells us what we should already know (but it's nice to hear): it's not about years on the job.

The second article that was posted went to this site: [Frontside.io](http://frontside.io/blog/2016/07/07/the-conjoined-triangles-of-senior-level-development.html)

### Frontside.io

Frontside had also had this question posed and spent a long time discussing it.
They boiled down a Senior Developer within their organisation into twelve
charactistics that they wanted to see. These were:
 - Connectedness
  - Community & OSS
    - Are they a member of an external community (not necessarily programmers). Do they, or are they able to, participate in groups in an active way should the need arise?
  - Mentorship
    - When asked for help do they provide it?
  - Empathic Development
    - When given a task, do they consider who else would benefit from the knowledge within the team and pro-actively offer pair programming (or similar).
  - Courageous Honesty
    - When asked their opinion, do they give it freely, or do they require prompting and cajouling?
 - Technical Capability
  - Curiosity
    - Do they have any? Do they spend their own time reading around programming in general? Or is the only curiosity they show when told exactly what to learn?
  - Rigor/Discipline
    - Heads down and get stuff done or occasional breaks? The breaks can be to read a news article or stretch their legs, but it's specifically not the task at hand.
  - Propensity to ship
    - Does the task finish when the software is done, or when it's in production?
  - Fearlessness
    - If faced with a new problem in an unfamiliar system, do they hesitate? Do they panic? Do they shy away?
 - Leadership
  - Owner's mindset
    - Are they precious about their code? Do they work to improve existing systems or do they just want to throw it away and start again?
  - Communication / Persuasion
    - Can they communicate and are they persuasive?
  - Purpose
    - Simply put, "Do they have one?". What's their driving motivation? If you're reading this, chances are that it's "to become Senior".
  - "Next Right Thing"
    - If left to their own devices, would they identify and work on the most pressing tasks?

This seemed like a good place to start. Someone had already done the work for us,
all we needed to do was apply it. However, how did these characteristics compare
to World First currently. It's all very well saying "Fearlessness is important",
but what if none of our existing Senior Developers had that trait? Could we
honestly tell a soon-to-be Senior Developer that they had to focus on a trait
that wasn't seemingly important to us?

The simple answer was, "no, we couldn't".

#### The Results

So I asked the team leads to rate their teams on the above 12 characteristics.
The attibutes were rated on a scale of:
 - "Yes they exhibit this trait (1)",
 - "No they don't exhibit this trait (0)"
 - "Otherwise (0.5)"

This meant, per person, we had a total. At this stage it didn't matter if the traits
were sensible for World First or not, that would come later. So, below is a chart
of total value vs. job title for the various teams.

[Results1]

One thing quickly becomes obvious, Senior Developers exhibit more of the above
than Software Developers. This was good news, it means there was a *tiny* amount
of truth in the characteristics. However, how did that pan out per trait? Were
there some traits which were simply more important than others? For that, we need
area diagrams:

[DeveloperAreaDiagram]

[SeniorDevAreaDiagram]

#### 1 down 11 to go...

Looking at the area diagrams, we don't have many people who are involved within
the community. This could simply be because they have a family to go back to
in the evenings, or live too far away for meetups to be sensible. Suffice to
say, it doesn't appear to be a barrier to becoming a Senior Developer.

#### 2 down 10 to go...

Once again, we look to the area diagrams, at 'Owners Mindset'. How similar it
is between Senior Developers and Software Developers. It's fair to say, within
World First, everyone seems to consider this equally.

#### 3 down 9 to go...

What about Rigor/Discipline? In some cultures a heads down attitude is
the **only** way to code. In others, having a regular break is entirely
normal. The team leads didn't feel we could judge anyone on how they prefer to
program. Some people work perpetually until they burn out, take a holiday,
come back and do it all over again. Others simply... don't.

Ultimately: it's an individuals choice.

#### What about the rest?

The striking difference between the area charts start at 'Mentorship' and go
around anti-clockwise to 'Fearlessness' (skipping Rigor/Discipline).

##### Mentorship

Helping other people when they ask, or offering to help when they appear to be
stuck. It doesn't have to be within your Chapter, it might be within your Sqaud.
Opportunties for mentorship might take the form of pair programming, or a
workshop to explain to a wider audience how something should be accomplished.
Mentorship is about sharing knowledge whilst helping others.

##### Empathic Development

Noticing that knowledge you have is lacking in others and offering to teach them.
Empathic Development is about sharing knowledge others might not have and so
reducing the amount of silo'd information. It doesn't have to be an area you're
working on currently. It's about noticing that you have knowledge someone else
doesn't and offering to teach them, rather than waiting for them to get stuck
on a task. Empathic Development can take many forms, but can frequently be seen
as "I have this task, my colleague doesn't know about it, I'll offer to pair program.",
or "I recently read this article (or set of articles) on <subject> and think
others will find it interesting".

##### Courageous Honesty

Imagine the following scenario: You're in a small meeting of your peers looking
over an existing code base. It's the worst codebase you've ever seen, it's *dire*.
There's a new feature for it though and the task has been handed to you. "Do you
foresee any problems?", your line manager asks. Courageous Honesty is not just
saying what your thoughts are, but also how to mitigate any problems. It's about
being able to identify areas that you don't have any knowledge of;
the "known unknowns". In the scenario you might say, "I don't know" and then elaborate
on the bits you're unsure about. Instead, you might say, "The code is a little
messy, so I can't foresee everything, this bit gives me cause for concern,
this other bit will be fine". Think of this as an exercise in risk communication
and you won't go far wrong.

##### Curiosity

Every single Senior Developer at World First shows an interest in programming,
a natural curiosity to better themselves and their understanding of programming.
This is frequently seen within World First as people reading blog posts or books,
trying out new architectures or even just playing with a new language. Curiosity
is about personal development as much as a sensible lead into Empathic Development.

##### Propensity to Ship

Does your task finish when you've finished programming it? This was a rhetorical
question, the answer is a resounding "No". Your tasks finish when they're in
production. A Propensity to Ship is the mindset of understanding deadlines,
knowing when to cut corners to reach those deadlines, and specifically,
getting tasks into production. One of the common tasks of a Senior Developer is
release management, so it's likely you don't currently have any say in whether
something is released or not. However, it's up to you to hound those that do
have such responsibilities to see your code in production.

Understanding deadlines and knowing when to cut corners are interesting points
here. You may be thinking, "But I want to do things The Right Way". If that's
the case, definitely read this blog
[this blog](http://mattbriggs.net/blog/2015/06/01/the-role-of-a-senior-developer/).
Sometimes, writing bad code so that money can be earnt sooner is better than writing
perfectly beautiful code but missing the deadline entirely.

##### Fearlessness

You're given a new task in an unfamiliar codebase, there's no documentation, no
test to speak of, and no front end to work through. Do you shy away from the task?
Are you hesitant of making a mistake? Fearlessness isn't the act of just diving
in gung-ho, it's the mindset, and experience, to know how to approach these
circumstances. Do you spend a day reading the code, running through the process
on paper? Do you attach a debugger and call the code? Maybe you spend a week
writing tests? Whatever your methodology, Fearlessness is taking the task,
and working through it, knowing that you're either going to be fine, or your
methodology is going to be improved.

#### Other Traits
The last few traits are Communication/Persuasion, Purpose and "Next Right Thing".
They're very similar between Software Developers and Senior Developers and so
quite difficult to comment on. They might become part of your mindset, and it
won't hurt for them to be so, but they're not essential.

##### Communication / Persuasion
"Can they communicate their ideas, can they persuade others they're right". You
can be the best programmer in the world, but if you can't communicate your ideas
people will only be able to learn from you by looking at your code. You'll have
had the design meetings, and decided what to do, and so your suggestion will
have been lost. Unable to explain how you would go about doing a task, another
architecture is used, and your chance to shine is gone. Communication is important.

A couple of weeks later another design meeting happens. You've prepared for this
one though, and can articulate what design you'd use for a problem and why you'd
use it. Then a question is raised, "Why this design and not <some other design>?".
Part of Persuasion is being able to identify the pros and cons in both your
suggestion *and* the alternative suggestion. Is your design robust enough to
stand up to scrutiny? Is it over engineered? Does the alternative design have
serious flaws? Will there be flaws in the future (e.g. the solution doesn't
scale, isn't extendable, etc). Persuasion is important.

##### Purpose

What drives you? For some, your purpose is likely to be, "I want to be a Senior
Developer", but is that all? What happens when you've gained the title of
Senior Developer? Is the title a means to an end, or a validation of your
abilities? Perhaps your Purpose is more domain based, "I want to learn as much
as possible about the financial services industry". How will becoming a Senior
Developer help further your Purpose?

##### "Next Right Thing"

Another scenario: "Your squads PDI person goes on holiday. Whilst on holiday
the squad finishes all the existing stories that were planned out". Would you
be able to take the lead in knowing what to do next? Would you be able to
communicate why that should be the next thing, and persuade others that it's
in their interests for your suggested task to be done over theirs? The "Next
Right Thing" is very subjective which is why it's in this section.
It'll be a feeling that, although a particular task might be really
uninspiring, it really does need to be done, to speed up improvement later.
It's not something you can be rated on either, because if a valid argument
can be made, perhaps that was "The Next Right Thing".

    <h1>Senior Dev Research</h1>
    <pre>
#1:
http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/25564/when-should-you-call-yourself-a-senior-developer

* Can handle the entire software dev life cycle end-to-end.
* Can lead others and others look to you for guidance
* Can self manage your projects

10,000 hours = 1250 8-hour days = 250 8-hour weeks = 5 years (48 hour weeks)
(Malcolm GladWell: Outliers)
Examples:
 - Mozart (First concerto at 21, writing music since 11)
 - The Beatles (3 years in Germany, played 1200 times, 5-8 hours per session)
 -- Low end 6000 hours
 -- High end 9600 high end
 - Bill Gates (Started MS at age 20)

* Someone who has mastered programming
 - Can design, code and test a system
 - Can talk to syetem architecture or component design
 - Understand and use design patterns
 - Anticipate performance bottlenecks
 - Knows not to pre-optimize
 - Leverage async programming
 - Knowledge and implementation of Queuing, Caching, Logging, Security, & Persistence
 - Can relate a detailed explanation of their choice and the pros/cons
 - Mastered OO Programming (Generally)
 - Knowledge of other programming languages (normally)

* Mastery by George Leonard suggests repetition is key. With each repetition improvement is found. "Only with this insight can you become beter".

* Length of time doesn't make a senior developer if there's no growth. Sitting at a computer for 10,000 hours doing the same task day-in, day-out doesn't make one senior.

* Suggestion for 4 levels:
 - Luminary (10+ years + talks at conferences + writes books): Works to improve the ecosystem as a whole not just themselves.
 - Senior (7 - 10+ years): High probability of never being a Luminary. Competent and Proficient programmer.
 - Mid (4 - 6 years): Understands day to day programming. They work independenty and create robust solutions. However, they have yet to experience creating or maintaining large or complex systems. In general Mid-Level develoeprs are great with component level development.
 - Junior (1 - 3 years): Basics of programming. Might have a degree, might be self taught. Their code is continually reviewed. Guidance needed with algorithms, maintainability and structure.

Martin Fowler mentioned with the following bullet points:
 * Nothing to do with how long at a company someone has been.
 * No ego
 * Don't pass blame, anticipate problems and address them in a positive manner.
 * People *want to work with them*.
 * Not the smartest engineers. They don't work on the most complex problems. It's not all about programming, but also communication skills.
 * Good at estimating
 * Care about what they do. An understanding that boring tasks must be completed to the same quality as any other, potentially more interesting, task.

 * Key is *deliberate* practise, not just repetition, but doing a task beyond current abilities.

 * So You Want to be a Programmer?
 - Be *interested* in programming
 - Actually program (adding to the 10,000 hours).
 -- "the maximal level of performance for individuals in a given domain is not attained automatically as a function of extended experience, but the level of performance can be increased even by highly experienced individuals as a result of deliberate efforts to improve." http://www2.umassd.edu/swpi/DesignInCS/expertise.html

"the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an appropriate difficulty level for the particular individual, informative feedback, and opportunities for repetition and corrections of errors." - http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521357349

 - Talk with other programmers; read other programs.

 - Degree not necessary:
"Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter" Eric Raymond, author of The New Hacker's Dictionary

 - Work on projects with other people
 - Work on projects *after* other people.
 - Learn other programming languages
 - Remember that there is a "computer" in "computer science"
 - Get involved in standardization

http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/

 * A lot of the aspects of the 'programmer competency' aren't relevant to World First, but are themselves useful things to know.
 * A little out of date, with Git useage immediately putting someone at lvl3 on source control.
 * In some cases, no chance to improve within World First as automated tools take over.

https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/aug/28/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-senior-developer

The Guardian have 5 sub groupings:
 * associate software developer
 * software developer
 * senior developer
   - Has an acknowledged area of expertise
   - Mentors and Coaches others on their team
   - Understands the goals of the team (particularly metrics)
   - Has an idea on how the team can delivery software more effectively
   - Is a strong individual contributor
   - Talks publicly or is involved in the wider software community outside the organisation.
 * lead developer
 * principal developer

-* No description on the other roles in comparison.


http://mattbriggs.net/blog/2015/06/01/the-role-of-a-senior-developer/

 * "A person with 10 years experience is quite different than someone who has experienced the same year 10 times."

 * "A junior developer is code focused, not development focused, and doesn’t understand the distinction. When a programmer talks about how they “would love coding more, if it weren’t for all the users”, I assume I am talking to a junior developer."

 * "A good junior developer can be given a known task, and be expected to execute it quickly, and well."

 * "Intermediates are quite aware of their role in their organization, and the value they bring. A good intermediate understands how using code to solve a problem is the means to an end, not the end in and of itself. However, they are still in love with ivory tower design, and are still on a quest for “The Right Way” to build software."

 * "A good intermediate developer needs less supervision. They can be trusted to raise issues of code design, and play a valuable role in design discussions. They are also the “workhorses” of the dev team. However, further mentoring and higher level supervision is still vital."

 * "A senior developer understands that leadership is not about power, it is about empowerment. It is not about direction, it is about serving."

http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/what-makes-a-developer-senior/

* Senior Developer has 10 years experience, rock solid understanding of theory, excellent debugging skills.
* They should be able to work closely with software architects to suggest improvements
* Should be able to ask questions at the architecture level and not at a low implementation level
* Serve as a resource and mentor for less experiences developers
* Should be able to take a set of class diagrams and turn it into quality code with little oversight.
* Senior developers do not require handholding.

However
* A person having done 12 years of VB is a "VB Senior Dev" not a general "Senior Dev".
* Someone who has spent those 12 years doing all manner of tasks in multiple languages is closer to "Senior Dev" than the previous one.
* Or how about someone who has done Client&Server vs. just Client or just Server dev. There's a tradeoff between specialist and generalist. Should WF be considering additional labels or multilevel specialisation?

* All technical considerations aside, does personality come into it?
 - Should a Senior Dev be someone with just the skills, or should their leadership ability be considered too?

http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/
* Doesn't matter if you can write Bloom Filters in Erlang in your sleep, it matters if people actually want to work with you.
* Mature engineers have self-awareness. They have a notion of where they could be better, and continually ask for a gut-check from peers and managers on how they're doing. They aim to be assertive, not passive or aggressive in how they get their ideas across.
* Should be able to critique code in a constructive fashion (not just identifying the problem, but offering solutions)
* Should not shy away from giving estimates and are always trying to improve.
* Should recognise bad code and either work to improve it, or highlight it for later improvement.
* Lift the skills and expertise of those around them
* Can't be _efficient_ and _thorough_ at the same time. ETTO principle
* "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil." - Knuth
** Corollary: "Understanding what is and isn't premature is what separates senior engineers from junior engineers."
* Senior Devs understand when to cut corners in order to get a product released which might then be generating revenue whilst the original product is refactored in the background.
